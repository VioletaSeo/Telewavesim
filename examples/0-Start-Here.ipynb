    "## Telewavesim: Python software for teleseismic body wave modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the Earth's crust and upper mantle give useful information on the \n",
    "internal composition and dynamics of our planet. One of the most widely used techniques\n",
    "to infer these properties is based on examining the interaction of teleseismic body waves \n",
    "(i.e., P and S waves that originate from distant earthquakes and arrive as plane waves)\n",
    "with subsurface properties of rocks. Modeling the seismic response from stacks of \n",
    "layers is therefore an essential tool in characterizing their effect on observed seismograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This python package contains modules to synthesize teleseismic \n",
    "body-wave propagation through stacks of generally anisotropic layers using the\n",
    "matrix propagator approach of Kennett (1983). The software also properly models \n",
    "reverberations from an overlying column of water, effectively simulating ocean-bottom \n",
    "seismic (OBS) station recordings. The software will be useful in a variety of \n",
    "teleseismic receiver-based studies, such as P or S receiver functions,\n",
    "long-period P-wave polarization, shear-wave splitting from core-refracted shear waves \n",
    "(i.e., SKS, SKKS), etc. Common computational workflows are covered in the Jupyter notebooks bundled with this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigation / Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two matching sets of Jupyter Notebooks - one for the pure Python and one for the Fortran implementations. The Fortran implementation provides much faster run times and may be the starting point for stochastic inverse methods. The Notebooks desribe how to reproduce published examples of synthetic data from [Audet (2016)](#references) and [Porter et al. (2011)](#references).\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need **Python 3.7+**.\n",
    "Also, the following packages are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`numpy`](http://numpy.org)\n",
    "- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "- [`obspy`](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)\n",
    "- [`pyfftw`](https://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "- [`fftw3`](http://www.fftw.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both `numpy` and `matplotlib` are installed as dependencies of `obspy`. See below for full installation details. You also need to download and install the `fftw3` library independently (conda install of `fftw3` is not working with current `gfortran` compiler). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise creating a custom [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)\n",
    "where `telewavesim` can be installed along with its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the repository:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim.git\n",
    "cd Telewavesim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new environment and install all dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n tws python=3.7 obspy pyfftw -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "or create it from the `tws_env.yml` file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f tws_env.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "Activate the newly created environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate tws\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pointing to `fftw3` library\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, edit the setup.py file to modify the content of ```extra_link_args``` in the Extension class to point to your compiled `fftw3` library. In the example below the library is install in ```/usr/local/lib```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ext = [Extension(name='telewavesim.rmat_f',\n",
    "                 sources=['src/rmat.f90', 'src/rmat_sub.f90'],\n",
    "                 extra_f90_compile_args=[\"-O3\"],\n",
    "                 extra_link_args=[\"-L/usr/local/lib\", \"-lfftw3\"])]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Installing using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the previous steps are performed, you can install `telewavesim` using pip:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Building and Installing\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can build and install the project (from the root of the source tree, e.g., inside the cloned `telewavesim` directory):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python setup.py build \n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, if you are actively working on the code, or making frequent edits, it is advisable\n",
    "to perform the pip installation with the `-e` flag. This enables an editable installation, where\n",
    "symbolic links are used rather than straight copies. This means that any changes made in the\n",
    "local folders will be reflected in the packages available on the system.\n",
