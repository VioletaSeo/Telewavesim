    "# Telewavesim: Python software for teleseismic body wave modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the Earth's crust and upper mantle give useful information on the \n",
    "internal composition and dynamics of our planet. One of the most widely used techniques\n",
    "to infer these properties is based on examining the interaction of teleseismic body waves \n",
    "(i.e., P and S waves that originate from distant earthquakes and arrive as plane waves)\n",
    "with subsurface properties of rocks. Modeling the seismic response from stacks of \n",
    "layers is therefore an essential tool in characterizing their effect on observed seismograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package contains `python` and `fortran` modules to synthesize teleseismic \n",
    "body-wave propagation through stacks of generally anisotropic and strictly horizontal \n",
    "layers using the matrix propagator approach of [Kennett (1983)](#references). \n",
    "The software also properly models reverberations from an overlying column of water, \n",
    "effectively simulating ocean-bottom seismic (OBS) station recordings. The software \n",
    "will be useful in a variety of teleseismic receiver-based studies, such as P or S \n",
    "receiver functions, long-period P-wave polarization, shear-wave splitting from \n",
    "core-refracted shear waves (i.e., SKS, SKKS), etc. It may also be the starting point \n",
    "for stochastic inverse methods (e.g., Monte Carlo sampling). The main part of the\n",
    "code is written in `fortran` with `python` wrappers. Common computational \n",
    "workflows are covered in the Jupyter notebooks bundled with this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigation / Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in this package is a set of Jupyter Notebooks, which give examples on how to call the various routines and obtain plane wave seismograms and receiver functions. The Notebooks desribe how to reproduce published examples of synthetic data from [Audet (2016)](#references) and [Porter et al. (2011)](#references).\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version was developed using **Python3.7**\n",
    "Also, the following packages are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`obspy`](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)\n",
    "- [`pyfftw`](https://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "- [`fftw`](http://www.fftw.org)\n",
    "- [`lapack`](http://www.netlib.org/lapack)\n",
    "- A working `Fortran` compiler (e.g., `gfortran`, Intel (c) `ifort`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By  default, both `numpy` and `matplotlib` are installed as dependencies of `obspy`. \n",
    "See below for full installation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more than one way to install the software. We highly recommend installing \n",
    "the software and its dependencies using the `conda` package manager in a virtual environment. \n",
    "However, we recognize that some users may prefer to use a different `Fortran` compiler \n",
    "(e.g., Intel (c) Fortran `ifort`), and we provide steps below to install the software using \n",
    "a system-wide available `Fortran` compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your choice, start with this step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clone the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim.git\n",
    "$ cd Telewavesim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda installation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the `conda-forge` channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We advise creating a custom \n",
    "[conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)\n",
    "where `telewavesim` can be installed along with its dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda create -n tws python=3.7 obspy pyfftw\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda env create -f tws_env.yml\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda activate tws\n",
    "(tws) $\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, depending on your preference, you can further use `conda` to install the required Fortran \n",
    "compiler and the `fftw` library (the `lapack` library will be already installed from the \n",
    "previous steps) or use a pre-existing `Fortran` compiler \n",
    "(see [Separate Fortran build](#separatefortranbuild)). Using a `conda` environment \n",
    "will point to the correct path for dynamic linking. On a MacOSX, the `gfortran` package is `gfortran_osx-64`; for Linux, the `gfortran` package is `gfortran_linux-64` (check out https://anaconda.org/search?q=gfortran for the available packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install `gfortran` and the `fftw` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(tws) $ conda install gfortran_osx-64 fftw\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check that the active Fortran compiler is the `conda` version residing in \n",
    "the `tws` path:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(tws) $ which gfortran\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(tws) $ pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Build and install the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(tws) $ python setup.py build \n",
    "(tws) $ python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separate Fortran build\n",
    "\n",
    "For `conda` users, we recommend creating and activating the `conda` environment as \n",
    "detailed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need to use a system-wide available Fortran compiler (e.g., located in \n",
    "`/usr/local/bin`), and independently download and install the `fftw` and `lapack`libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once this is done, edit the `setup.py` file to modify the content of `extra_link_args` in the `Extension` class to point to the location of your compiled `fftw` and `lapack` libraries. In the example below the libraries are installed in `/usr/local/lib`:\n",
